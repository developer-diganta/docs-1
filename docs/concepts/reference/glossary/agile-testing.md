### What is agile unit testing?

Agile unit testing is a software testing technique that focuses on testing individual units of code in a software application. The goal of agile unit testing is to find and fix defects early in the development process, before they can cause bigger problems.

### Why is agile unit testing important?

Agile unit testing is important because it can help to improve the quality of software applications. By finding and fixing defects early, agile unit testing can help to prevent bugs from reaching production, which can save time and money.

### How does agile unit testing work?

Agile unit testing is typically done by developers. Developers write unit tests that verify the behavior of individual units of code. These unit tests are then run automatically as part of the development process.

### What are the benefits of agile unit testing?

The benefits of agile unit testing include:

1.Increased quality of software applications
2.Reduced number of defects
3.Faster time to market
4.Lower development costs
5.How to do agile unit testing?

### There are a few things to keep in mind when doing agile unit testing:

1.Write unit tests early in the development process.
2.Write unit tests that are fast and easy to run.
3.Write unit tests that are easy to understand and maintain.
4.Run unit tests frequently as part of the development process.

### Conclusion

Agile unit testing is a valuable tool for improving the quality of software applications. By following the best practices for agile unit testing, developers can help to ensure that their applications are free of defects and meet the needs of their users.
